# AdoptAPet

This project was generated with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) and uses React version 18.3.1.

## Overview

**AdoptAPet** is a web application built using **React** for the frontend and **Firebase** for backend services. **Firebase** is utilized for various backend functionalities, including:

- **Authentication**: Handles user registration, login, and authentication. Firebase Authentication provides secure and simple ways to manage user sessions.
- **Firestore**: Used as the NoSQL database to store and retrieve pet adoption profiles and user information.

## üöÄ Features

### üîë User Authentication and Registration
- **Guest Access**: Guests, or users who are not logged in, can browse the dashboard and view pet details but cannot adopt a pet or view owner contact details.
- **User Login and Registration**: Users can register for an account or log in to gain full access to the platform, including the ability to create, edit, and delete adoption profiles.

### üêæ Pet Adoption Profiles
- **Dashboard Access**: All users can view the available pets listed on the dashboard. Guests can see pet details, but adoption actions are restricted to logged-in users.
- **Profile Creation**: Authenticated users can create detailed adoption profiles for pets, including information like name, breed, age, health information and an optional image.
- **Adopt a Pet**: Once logged in, users can adopt a pet by clicking the "Adopt" button on the pet's details page. Adopting a pet reveals the owner's contact details.
- **Profile Management**: Users who have created a profile can edit or delete it. Only the creator of the profile has the authority to make these changes.

### üìä Dashboard Features: Pagination and Filters
- **Pagination**: The dashboard currently lists all available pets. **Pagination is planned but not yet implemented**, so all pets are displayed on a single page.
- **Filter/Search**: While users can browse the dashboard, **a search and filter function** to easily find specific pets based on criteria like breed or age is **not yet available**.

### ‚≠ê Likes Page and User Profile Details
- **Likes Page**: A **"Likes" page, where users can view and manage pets they have shown interest in, is planned but not yet implemented**. The link to this page is present in the navigation bar for authenticated users.
- **User Profile Details**: A **user profile section is planned to allow users to manage their personal details. This feature is not yet available**, but a placeholder link is present in the navigation bar when a user is logged in.

### üõ†Ô∏è Pet Details and Management
- **Viewing Details**: Any user can explore detailed information about each pet, but only logged-in users can see the owner's contact details after adopting a pet.
- **Editing and Deleting Profiles**: Profile owners can edit or delete their pet profiles. Deleting a profile permanently removes it from the Firestore database after confirmation.

### üõ°Ô∏è Form Validation and Error Handling
- **Data Validation**: Forms are equipped with validation. Invalid forms are not accepted, and users receive error messages (**not very clear yet**).
- **Error Notifications**: The platform informs the users for errors or confirm successful actions.

### üîí Security and Access Control
- **Route Guards**: Access to sensitive pages like profile creation and editing is restricted to logged-in users. Additionally, only the owners of a profile can edit or delete it.

---

AdoptAPet is developed with **React** and **Firebase**, utilizing **React Router DOM** for navigation and **React Toastify** for notifications. This project is continually evolving, with future updates planned to enhance user experience and add new features.

**Note:** This project was developed for an exam and is not being actively maintained. Some features, such as **pagination**, **filter/search**, **Likes page**, and **user profile details**, are planned but **not yet implemented** in the current version.
